# APN Settings

APN Settings is an Android app that acts as a shortcut to the 
APN Settings section of Android Settings.

(This app is an update to the app provided by tompreuss back in 2015, and is now updated for use with dual sims, and phones that have multiple active subscription id's *added in lollipop and forward*)


This app was forked, but due to upgrade issues with gradle, I just did a quick and dirty rebuild from the ground up with SDK 11, and gradle 3.2 in android studio. For building, simply use android studio with the aforementioned SDK and gradle versions.

Second note: Since I did not care what this app looked like other than launching the apn settings when clicked, there is extraneous code. If anyone feels like cleaning it up, be my guest, but I just made this for a friend who was tired of going through settings to swap APN presents in android 12.
